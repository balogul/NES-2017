<BR><h3><b> mSBC_audio_codec_cc26xx_cc13xx Licenses </b></h3><BR> <BR><BR>                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>                       Version 2.1, February 1999<BR><BR> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<BR> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<BR> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<BR> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<BR><BR>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<BR> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<BR> the version number 2.1.]<BR><BR>                            Preamble<BR><BR>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<BR>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<BR>Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<BR>free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<BR><BR>  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<BR>specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<BR>Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<BR>can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<BR>this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<BR>strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<BR><BR>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<BR>not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<BR>you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<BR>for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<BR>it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<BR>it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<BR>these things.<BR><BR>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<BR>distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<BR>rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<BR>you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<BR><BR>  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<BR>or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<BR>you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<BR>code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<BR>complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<BR>with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<BR>it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<BR><BR>  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<BR>library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<BR>permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<BR><BR>  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<BR>there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<BR>modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<BR>that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<BR>author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<BR>introduced by others.<BR><BR>  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<BR>any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<BR>effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<BR>restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<BR>any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<BR>consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<BR><BR>  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<BR>ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<BR>is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<BR>this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<BR>libraries into non-free programs.<BR><BR>  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<BR>a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<BR>combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<BR>General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<BR>entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<BR>Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<BR>the library.<BR><BR>  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<BR>does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<BR>Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<BR>of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<BR>are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<BR>libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<BR>special circumstances.<BR><BR>  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<BR>encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<BR>a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<BR>allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<BR>library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<BR>case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<BR>software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<BR><BR>  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<BR>programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<BR>free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<BR>non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<BR>operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<BR>system.<BR><BR>  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<BR>users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<BR>linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<BR>that program using a modified version of the Library.<BR><BR>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<BR>"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<BR>former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<BR>be combined with the library in order to run.<BR><BR>                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<BR><BR>  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<BR>program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<BR>other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<BR>this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<BR>Each licensee is addressed as "you".<BR><BR>  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<BR>prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<BR>(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<BR><BR>  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<BR>which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<BR>Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<BR>copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<BR>portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<BR>straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<BR>included without limitation in the term "modification".)<BR><BR>  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<BR>making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<BR>all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<BR>interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<BR>and installation of the library.<BR><BR>  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<BR>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<BR>running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<BR>such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<BR>on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<BR>writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<BR>and what the program that uses the Library does.<BR><BR>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<BR>complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<BR>you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<BR>appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<BR>all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<BR>warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<BR>Library.<BR><BR>  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<BR>and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<BR>fee.<BR><BR>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<BR>of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<BR>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<BR>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR><BR>    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<BR><BR>    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<BR>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<BR><BR>    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<BR>    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<BR><BR>    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<BR>    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<BR>    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<BR>    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<BR>    in the event an application does not supply such function or<BR>    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<BR>    its purpose remains meaningful.<BR><BR>    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<BR>    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<BR>    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<BR>    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<BR>    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<BR>    root function must still compute square roots.)<BR><BR>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<BR>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<BR>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<BR>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<BR>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<BR>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<BR>on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<BR>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<BR>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<BR>it.<BR><BR>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<BR>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<BR>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<BR>collective works based on the Library.<BR><BR>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<BR>with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<BR>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<BR>the scope of this License.<BR><BR>  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<BR>License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<BR>this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<BR>that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<BR>instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<BR>ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<BR>that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<BR>these notices.<BR><BR>  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<BR>that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<BR>subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<BR><BR>  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<BR>the Library into a program that is not a library.<BR><BR>  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<BR>derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<BR>under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<BR>it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<BR>must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<BR>medium customarily used for software interchange.<BR><BR>  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<BR>from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<BR>source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<BR>distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<BR>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<BR><BR>  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<BR>Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<BR>linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<BR>work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<BR>therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<BR><BR>  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<BR>creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<BR>contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<BR>library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<BR>Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<BR><BR>  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<BR>that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<BR>derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<BR>Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<BR>linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<BR>threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<BR><BR>  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<BR>structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<BR>functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<BR>file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<BR>work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<BR>Library will still fall under Section 6.)<BR><BR>  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<BR>distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<BR>Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<BR>whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<BR><BR>  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<BR>link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<BR>work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<BR>under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<BR>modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<BR>engineering for debugging such modifications.<BR><BR>  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<BR>Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<BR>this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<BR>during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<BR>copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<BR>directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<BR>of these things:<BR><BR>    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<BR>    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<BR>    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<BR>    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<BR>    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<BR>    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<BR>    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<BR>    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<BR>    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<BR>    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<BR>    to use the modified definitions.)<BR><BR>    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<BR>    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<BR>    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<BR>    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<BR>    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<BR>    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<BR>    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<BR><BR>    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<BR>    least three years, to give the same user the materials<BR>    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<BR>    than the cost of performing this distribution.<BR><BR>    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<BR>    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<BR>    specified materials from the same place.<BR><BR>    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<BR>    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<BR><BR>  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<BR>Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<BR>reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<BR>the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<BR>normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<BR>components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<BR>which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<BR>the executable.<BR><BR>  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<BR>restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<BR>accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<BR>use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<BR>distribute.<BR><BR>  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<BR>Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<BR>facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<BR>library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<BR>the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<BR>permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<BR><BR>    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<BR>    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<BR>    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<BR>    Sections above.<BR><BR>    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<BR>    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<BR>    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<BR><BR>  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<BR>the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<BR>attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<BR>distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<BR>rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<BR>or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<BR>terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<BR><BR>  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<BR>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<BR>distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<BR>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<BR>modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<BR>Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<BR>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<BR>the Library or works based on it.<BR><BR>  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<BR>Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<BR>original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<BR>subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<BR>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<BR>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<BR>this License.<BR><BR>  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<BR>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<BR>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<BR>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<BR>may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<BR>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<BR>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<BR>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<BR>refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<BR><BR>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<BR>particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<BR>and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<BR><BR>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<BR>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<BR>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<BR>integrity of the free software distribution system which is<BR>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<BR>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<BR>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<BR>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<BR>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<BR>impose that choice.<BR><BR>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<BR>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<BR><BR>  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<BR>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<BR>original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<BR>an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<BR>so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<BR>excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<BR>written in the body of this License.<BR><BR>  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<BR>versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<BR>Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<BR>but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<BR>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<BR>"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<BR>conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<BR>the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<BR>license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<BR>the Free Software Foundation.<BR><BR>  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<BR>programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<BR>write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<BR>copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<BR>Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<BR>decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<BR>of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<BR>and reuse of software generally.<BR><BR>                            NO WARRANTY<BR><BR>  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<BR>WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<BR>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<BR>OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<BR>KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<BR>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<BR>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<BR>LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<BR>THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR><BR>  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<BR>WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<BR>AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<BR>FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<BR>CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<BR>LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<BR>RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<BR>FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<BR>SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<BR>DAMAGES.<BR><BR>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR><BR>           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<BR><BR>  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<BR>everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<BR>redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<BR>ordinary General Public License).<BR><BR>  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<BR>safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<BR>"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR><BR>    &ltone line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><BR>    Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR><BR>    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<BR>    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<BR>    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<BR>    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<BR><BR>    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<BR>    Lesser General Public License for more details.<BR><BR>    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<BR>    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<BR>    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<BR><BR>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<BR><BR>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<BR>school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<BR>necessary.
